To run the programs you need to have python 3.5 installed. It might work with python 2.x
It’s important that the file structure stays the same.

Run the homework1.py by typing ’python homework1.py *instance_size* *algorithm* *number_of_loops*’ each argument separated with a space and press enter
Instance sizes can be either 4,10,15,20,22,25,27,30,32,35,37,40.
Algorithm can be either bruteforce or greedy.
Number_of_loops is optional and is by default 1.

OPTIONAL
There should be no need to run the plot_time.py or plot_errors.py as these are presented in the report but they are run in a similar fashion as homework1.py. They take either bruteforce or greedy as an argument.
